# Ocean Dive

Ocean Dive is a VR game for HTC Vive that simulates diving in the ocean. The player can discover fish species and pick up objects from the sea floor, but they must return to the surface before running out of oxygen.

The project was created together with Ethan Wu using Unity and [VRTK](https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK).
